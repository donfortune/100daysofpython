# Introduction to Test Driven Development in Python

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where you write tests for your code before you write the actual code. The cycle typically follows these steps: write a test, run the test (it should fail because the code isn't written yet), write the code, and run the test again (it should pass this time). TDD helps ensure that your code meets the requirements and remains functional as it evolves.

As stated above, the following steps are involved in TDD:
* Write the test
* Run the test -> should fail, beacuse there is no code
* Write the code
* Run the code again -> should work since you now have the code

Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python typically involves using testing frameworks and libraries to create and run tests. Here are some popular testing modules and libraries used for TDD in Python:
* Unittest
* Pytest
* Nose2
* Doctest
* Hypothesis
* Mock
