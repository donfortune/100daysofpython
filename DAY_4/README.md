decorators are a powerful and flexible way to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods without changing their actual code. Decorators are often used for tasks such as logging, memoization, access control, and more. They provide a clean and concise syntax for applying reusable transformations to functions or methods.

A decorator is a function that takes another function as input, extends or modifies the behavior of that function, and returns a new function. The @decorator syntax is a convenient way to apply decorators to functions or methods.
